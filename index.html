<p> After working in Gtech for 2 years on various projects, I decided to change my path and swtich from corporate to startup company.
  I've joined <a href="http://trucktrack.co">TruckTrack</a> and help them build a modern SaaS solution for managing trucking companies.
  With my mission done there, I joined San Francisco based company  <a href="http://embroker.com">Embroker</a> as #4 engineer and seen company grow from barely 10 to 100 people. 
  Meanwhile I decided to move to Berlin, since I wanted to join a bit bigger community and have a better base for traveling around. There I'm helping <a href="http://escriba.de">Escriba</a> to rewrite their old legacy clients in a newer technologies.
  You can motivate me with a great and interesting projects but not money. You can check "let's work toghether" section for more details.</p>
